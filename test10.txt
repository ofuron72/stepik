Had I the heavens embroidered cloths,
Enwrought with golden and silver light,
The blue and the dim of the dark cloths
Of night and light and the half-light,
I would spread the cloths under your feet:
But I being poor have only my dreams;
I have spread my dreams under your feet;
Tread softly, because you thread on my dreams.
                      -William Buttler
There are only two way to live your life.  One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle
